# Ratings-Reviews-Server
Our team was tasked with reimplementing the Atelier API, a retail API, to scale for higher web traffic. We split the API into four services, and I worked on the Ratings & Reviews service. Ratings & Reviews allows users to get and post reviews on a certain product. It handles multiple inputs such as the different characteristics of each product, review photos, review summary & body, ratings, and whether or not a review is helpfull.
